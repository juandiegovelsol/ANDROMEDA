There should be a sticky interactive “Table of Contents” section. There should be a Live Search feature that includes filters by tags and authors. There should be a feature called ‘Customization Tools,’ which will include options to toggle dark/light mode, adjust font size and line height, and choose a reading mode: standard or immersive.

A valid critique must clearly flag at least two of these problems:\n1. You cannot view the actual posts that are scheduled, published, or awaiting approval—only their counts.\n2. There is no way to mark or review draft posts, so teammates cannot comment on drafts.\n3. The light-blue / dark-blue color switch is unreliable and unlabeled.\n4. In the messaging pane, every keystroke triggers an unnecessary page refresh (visible as a flashing “unread messages” count).\n5. The profile-information pop-up is clipped because its overflow is hidden.\n\nYour task: Decide whether the candidate’s justification unmistakably calls out two or more of these defects—even if they use close synonyms or regional spellings.\n\nAcceptable keyword families\nA. Posts-visibility family – phrases like “scheduled list missing,” “can’t see queued posts,” “no view of awaiting-approval items,” “only counters,” “posts not visible,” etc.\nB. Draft-commenting family – mentions of “draft post,” “draft workflow,” “comment on drafts,” “no ‘draft’ status,” “can’t mark as draft,” etc.\nC. Color-toggle family – tokens such as “color switch,” “blue toggle,” “square button top left,” “needs double click,” “no icon,” “should be a slider,” “doesn’t change shade,” etc.\nD. Typing-refresh family – words like “refresh on keystroke,” “page reloads while typing,” “flashing unread counter,” “auto-refresh in chat,” etc.\nE. Popup-cutoff family – phrases like “profile popup clipped,” “content cut off,” “overflow hidden,” “popup too small,” “dialog cropped,” etc.\n\nScoring rules\n• 1.0 – The response includes keywords from at least two different families and clearly states or implies that each referenced aspect is problematic.\n• 0.0 – Otherwise. Partial credit is not allowed. Ignore any other comments.\n\nOutput format – return only the numeric score (1.0 or 0.0) with no extra text.\n\nCandidate response to evaluate (delimited by triple angle brackets):\n<<<\n{{response}}\n>>>",
